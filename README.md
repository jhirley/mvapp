# mvapp   This is a my repo for the Joe eames pluralsight couse on building a MEAN app.
I am stuck at the passport authentication.  have a few console.log with the the user data from the angular contollers which are in public/app/{./auth}  which log to the browser console and have the correct data.

I also have console.logs in the server side logic in server.js and server/config/   which logs the command line which have incorrect data.  For the passport custom callback my user is being returned as false.
